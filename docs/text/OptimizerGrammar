full: got code

  We stop eating scanner cookies when we found these two rules :-).

got: SECT_GOT body_SECT_GOT

  We have the global offset table when we've read SECT_GOT (which is the
  string ".got") and we've also read section's body.

body_SECT_GOT: ID OFFSET | body_SECT_GOT ID OFFSET

  We have the got section's body when we've read an indefinite number of
  ID OFFSET (Thanks to the left recursive rule).

code: SECT_CODE body_SECT_CODE
body_SECT_CODE: line_SECT_CODE | body_SECT_CODE line_SECT_CODE

  The code is defined in the same way as got (and body_SECT_CODE like
  body_SECT_GOT).

line_SECT_CODE: ...

  The various sequence for the possible instructions. The only thing that
  needs to be stressed is the fact that we always read VM_JTRUE-VM_JFALSE
  pair, for the reason explained in optimizer/optimizer.h.
